# pj_media Architecture

The HOW document for the pj_media module. `REQUIREMENTS.md` defines WHAT
pj_media does; this document defines HOW it is built. Read `REQUIREMENTS.md`
first — this document assumes familiarity with every section.

Cross-references to REQUIREMENTS.md use `§R` notation (e.g., `§R4.3`).
Cross-references to `OBJECT_STORE_DESIGN.md` use `§OS` notation (e.g., `§OS3.4`).

## 1. Module Structure

pj_media ships as two CMake targets with a strict dependency direction:

```
pj_media_qt  ──►  pj_media_core  ──►  pj_base
     │                  │                  │
     │                  ├──►  pj_datastore │

     └──►  pj_media_core                  │
```

### pj_media_core (no Qt)

Pure C++ library. Contains everything that does not touch Qt:

| Component | Header(s) | Role |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| `FrameSlot` | `frame_slot.h` | Single-slot latest-wins mailbox (§3) |
| `PlaybackController` | `playback_controller.h` | Per-widget orchestrator: owns decoders, worker thread(s), FrameSlot (§5) |
| `VideoBackend` | `video_backend.h` | Abstract video playback interface; v1 uses libmpv, future: custom FFmpeg (§4) |
| `ImageDecoder` | `image_decoder.h` | turbojpeg / libpng / raw-pixel dispatch (§4) |
| `SceneDecoder` | `scene_decoder.h` | CDR / Protobuf deserializer for annotations and 2D primitives (§4) |
| `MediaIndexRegistry` | `media_index_registry.h` | Per-topic keyframe timestamp index sidechannel (§6) |
| `Compositor` | `compositor.h` | Multi-layer decode orchestration and blending (§8) |
| `CancelToken` | `cancel_token.h` | Atomic flag polled by decoders between decode units |
| `DecodedFrame` | `decoded_frame.h` | RAII wrapper for decoded pixel data (YUV planes or RGB buffer) |

DataSource plugins do NOT link `pj_media_core` — plugins depend only
on `pj_base` (see `pj_plugins/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). Format-specific
helpers (NAL scanning, PTS lookup) belong inside the DataSource plugin
itself or in lightweight headers within `pj_base`.

### pj_media_qt (Qt widgets)

Qt widget library built on top of `pj_media_core`:

| Component | Header(s) | Role |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| `MediaViewerWidget` | `media_viewer_widget.h` | `QRhiWidget` subclass: GPU rendering for images, zoom/pan, shader pipeline (§7) |
| `VideoViewerWidget` | `video_viewer_widget.h` | `QOpenGLWidget` that owns a `VideoBackend`; mpv renders into its FBO (§4.1) |
| `MpvBackend` | `mpv_backend.h` | libmpv `VideoBackend` implementation (v1 video backend) |
| `MediaViewerFactory` | `media_viewer_factory.h` | Creates the right viewer type from topic `metadata_json` |
| Texture shaders | `shaders/texture.{vert,frag}` | RGBA texture display with view transform matrix |

The Qt layer is thin — it owns the GPU surface and polls the
`PlaybackController`'s `FrameSlot` at render rate. All decode logic,
threading, and cancellation live in `pj_media_core`.

---

## 2. Data Flow

Two paths: write (ingest) and read (display). pj_media participates
only in the read path.

### Write path (ingest — pj_media is NOT involved)

```
DataSource plugin
  ├─► [direct]    ObjectStore::pushOwned / pushLazy       ◄── v1
  └─► [delegated] host.pushRawMessage ─► MessageParser::parse()
                                            ├─► scalar write host  (DataEngine)
                                            └─► object write host  (ObjectStore)
                                                                   ◄── requires parser ABI v2
```

**V1 supports direct ingest only.** DataSource plugins call
`pushOwned` / `pushLazy` directly. Delegated ingest (via
`MessageParser::parse()` with two hosts) requires parser ABI v2
(two-host `parse()` signature), which is an outstanding prerequisite
(see `REQUIREMENTS.md` Prerequisites). Delegated ingest is a
subsequent milestone.

### Read path (display — pj_media's domain)

```

                           ▼
                      GPU display
```

On each render tick:

1. `PlaybackController` receives the current timestamp from
   `TimelineCursor`.
2. For each active layer: call `ObjectStore::latestAt(topic, ts)` to
   get an owning byte handle.
3. Each layer's decoder decodes its bytes independently.
4. `Compositor` combines per-layer outputs per the widget's layer
   configuration.
5. The composited frame is written to the widget's `FrameSlot`.
6. The UI thread's render timer polls `FrameSlot::take()` and uploads
   the frame to the GPU.

Steps 2-5 run on the `PlaybackController`'s worker thread(s).
Step 6 runs on the Qt main thread.

---

## 3. Scrub Architecture

This section ports the patterns proven in
`~/ws_plotjuggler/video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3` into pj_media's
architecture. That document is the canonical reference for WHY these
patterns work and WHY alternatives fail — read it before modifying
anything in this section.

### 3.1 FrameSlot — the single-slot mailbox

The `FrameSlot` is the mechanism that eliminates stale-frame
interleaving during scrub. It is ~60 lines of code:

```cpp
struct CompositeFrame {
  // Blended pixel buffer from all active layers (RGB or YUV).
  // Exact representation is an implementation detail; may be a
  // shared_ptr to a pixel buffer, an AVFrame, or a QImage.
};

struct SlotResult {
  int64_t timestamp_ns;
  CompositeFrame frame;
};

class FrameSlot {
 public:
  void store(int64_t timestamp_ns, CompositeFrame frame);
  std::optional<SlotResult> take();

 private:
  std::mutex mutex_;
  CompositeFrame frame_;
  int64_t timestamp_ns_ = 0;
  bool has_new_ = false;
};
```

Properties:

- **Latest-wins**: `store()` physically overwrites the previous frame.
  A stale frame cannot reach the display because it is replaced before
  the UI polls.
- **At most two composite frames alive** (one in the slot, one being
  displayed). Memory usage is bounded.
- **No Qt event queue involvement**. No `QMetaCallEvent`, no
  `QueuedConnection`, no `invokeMethod`. The only synchronization
  primitive is `std::mutex`.
- **Pull timing**: the UI polls via `QTimer::timeout` at ~60 Hz. On
  each tick: `auto r = slot_.take(); if (r) uploadToGpu(r->frame);`.

The video_player_lab prototype uses frame indices as identifiers
because it is file-only (§5.1-5.2 of that document). pj_media uses
`int64_t` nanosecond timestamps instead — the universal coordinate
that works for both file and streaming sources.

**Qt signals are NOT used for frame delivery.** Adding a signal escape
hatch is explicitly forbidden. See
`~/ws_plotjuggler/video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.2-3.3` for the
structural proof that push-based delivery via Qt event queues cannot be
fixed by patching, and the enumeration of 5+ failed patches that must
not be retried.

### 3.2 Direction-aware cancel-store

When the user scrubs rapidly, in-flight decodes are cancelled via
`CancelToken` (an `atomic<bool>` polled between decode units). The
question is: should a partially-decoded frame be published to the
`FrameSlot`?

The rule, proven in
`~/ws_plotjuggler/video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.6`:

- **Forward scrub** (`current_request_ts > previous_request_ts`):
  publish partials. The decoder is decoding toward the target from a
  keyframe behind it — partial progress shows frames between the
  previous position and the target, which matches the user's drag
  direction.
- **Backward scrub** (`current_request_ts < previous_request_ts`):
  suppress partials. The decoder replays FORWARD from a keyframe
  while the user is dragging BACKWARD — publishing partials would
  show frames moving in the wrong direction.
- **Same position or first request**: suppress.

Implementation: `PlaybackController` tracks `last_request_ts_` and
sets a `suppress_partial_publication_` flag on the active decode
before each new request. The decoder checks this flag in its cancel
path.

### 3.3 CancelToken

Each decode request carries a `CancelToken` — a class wrapping an
`atomic<bool>`, shared between requester and decoder via
`shared_ptr<CancelToken>`:

```cpp
class CancelToken {
 public:
  bool isCancelled() const { return flag_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed); }
  void cancel() { flag_.store(true, std::memory_order_relaxed); }

 private:
  std::atomic<bool> flag_{false};
};
```

Decoders poll `token->isCancelled()` at natural check points:

- `VideoDecoder`: between NAL units (after each `avcodec_receive_frame`).
- `ImageDecoder`: between JPEG MCU rows (if turbojpeg supports
  progressive; otherwise after the single decode call).
- `SceneDecoder`: between primitives in a batch message.

A new request flips the previous token. The decoder returns early, and
the `PlaybackController` decides whether to publish the partial result
based on the direction-aware rule (§3.2).

---

## 4. Decoder Classes

Decoders are built-in C++ classes in `pj_media_core`. They are NOT
plugins — codec state is per-viewer, per-layer, and adding new codecs
requires a pj_media code change.

### 4.1 Video: VideoBackend abstraction

Video playback uses a `VideoBackend` abstract interface defined in
`pj_media_core`. Concrete backends handle file I/O, decoding,
seeking, and HW acceleration internally. The widget layer calls
`open()`, `seek()`, `setPaused()`, and `renderFrame()` without
knowing which backend is active.

**V1 backend: libmpv (`MpvBackend`).**  mpv handles all codec,
container, HW-accel, keyframe seeking, and frame caching internally.
This means §6 (`MediaIndexRegistry`) and the keyframe-seek algorithm
described there are **not used for video in v1** — mpv manages its
own keyframe index. The `VideoViewerWidget` (a `QOpenGLWidget`)
owns a `MpvBackend` and renders via mpv's OpenGL FBO API.

**Future backend: custom FFmpeg pipeline.**  If profiling shows mpv's
overhead is too high, a direct FFmpeg `AVCodecContext` wrapper can
be implemented as a second `VideoBackend`. That backend would use
`MediaIndexRegistry` for keyframe seeking, `CancelToken` for
cooperative cancellation, and `FrameSlot` for frame delivery — the
full pipeline described in §3 and §6. The `VideoBackend` abstraction
ensures this swap does not change the widget or controller.

**Design note**: `VideoBackend` uses `double seconds` for seek and
position rather than `int64_t` nanoseconds. This matches libmpv's
native API. The application-level `TimelineCursor` (§9) uses
nanoseconds; the conversion happens at the boundary between
`PlaybackController` and `VideoBackend`.

### 4.2 ImageDecoder

Stateless. One instance per image layer. Multiple instances in one
widget are fine (they share no state).

Dispatches based on the image encoding (from topic `metadata_json`):

| Encoding | Library | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| JPEG | turbojpeg | `tjDecompress2` → RGB888. < 10 ms for typical frames; caching decoded output is not worth the memory |
| PNG | libpng | Standard decode path |
| Raw pixels | memcpy | mono8, rgb8, rgba8, bgr8, bgra8 — copy into `DecodedFrame` with format tag |
| Depth (mono16) | custom | 16-bit depth → colormap in the compositor (§8) |

No decoded-frame cache. On-the-fly decode is fast enough for stills
that caching wastes more memory than it saves time (§R4.2).

### 4.3 SceneDecoder

Stateless. One instance per scene/annotation layer. Deserializes CDR
or Protobuf wire format into typed scene primitives and annotations
(see `datatypes_2D.md` for the type catalog).

Output is a `SceneFrame` — a collection of typed primitives ready for
the compositor to rasterize or overlay.

---

## 5. PlaybackController

The per-widget orchestrator. One `PlaybackController` per
`MediaViewerWidget`. Owns:

- One decoder instance per active layer (§R4.6).
- The widget's single `FrameSlot`.
- One or more worker threads for decode.
- The `Compositor` instance.
- `CancelToken` management.
- Scrub direction tracking (`last_request_ts_`).

### 5.1 Lifecycle

**Construction**: receives references to `ObjectStore`,
`TimelineCursor`, and the list of layer descriptors (topic +
decoder type per layer). Instantiates decoders, starts worker
thread(s).

**Destruction**: cancels in-flight decodes, joins worker threads,
releases ObjectStore handles. Must complete before `ObjectStore`
or `TimelineCursor` are destroyed.

### 5.2 Request processing

When `TimelineCursor` advances to a new timestamp:

1. `PlaybackController` compares `new_ts` to `last_request_ts_`
   to determine scrub direction.
2. Cancels the previous `CancelToken`.
3. Creates a new `CancelToken` for this request.
4. Sets `suppress_partial_publication_` based on direction (§3.2).
5. Posts the request to the worker thread(s).

The worker thread:

1. For each layer: calls `ObjectStore::latestAt(topic, ts)` to get
   the owning byte handle.
2. Passes each handle to the layer's decoder.
3. Collects decoded outputs; passes them to the `Compositor`.
4. Writes the composited result to the `FrameSlot`.

### 5.3 Worker thread model

**V1 architecture: single worker thread per widget.** One thread
drives all per-layer decoders sequentially per render tick, then
composites and writes to the `FrameSlot`. This is simple and adequate
for typical workloads (video + annotation overlay + optional depth).

The three contractual guarantees from §R4.6 hold trivially under this
model: decoders don't share state (sequential on the same thread),
one FrameSlot per widget, and stale frames cannot reach the display
(latest-wins slot semantics).

**Future possibility: per-layer worker threads.** If profiling shows
that a heavy video decode blocks lightweight overlay decodes, per-layer
parallelism could improve responsiveness. This is NOT part of the v1
architecture because it requires designing a compositor barrier
(ensuring all layers are decoded for the same timestamp before
compositing) and a generation model (preventing stale per-layer
results from leaking into the composite). These mechanisms are not
yet specified.

---

## 6. MediaIndexRegistry

Keyframe tracking lives in pj_media, not in ObjectStore (§R4.2,
§R4.4). The `MediaIndexRegistry` is the sidechannel that holds
per-topic keyframe timestamp lists.

```cpp
class MediaIndexRegistry {
 public:
  void registerIndex(ObjectTopicId topic,
                     std::vector<int64_t> keyframe_timestamps);

  void appendKeyframe(ObjectTopicId topic, int64_t timestamp);

  std::optional<int64_t> keyframeBefore(ObjectTopicId topic,
                                         int64_t timestamp) const;

  void removeIndex(ObjectTopicId topic);
};
```

**Keying**: entries are keyed by `ObjectTopicId`, not topic name
strings — consistent with the rest of the system.

**Lifecycle**: entries are cleared when the corresponding topic is
removed from ObjectStore (`removeTopic`, `clear`). The application
is responsible for calling `removeIndex()` as part of topic teardown.
Widgets observing a removed topic will find no keyframe index and
fall back to sequential decode (no seeking).

### Two population modes

**File-backed sources**: the DataSource plugin pre-computes the
keyframe list at open time — by scanning NAL start codes (H.264/H.265),
reading the MP4 `stss` (sync sample) atom, or equivalent. It publishes
the sorted timestamp array via the C ABI slot
`object_write_host.publish_keyframe_index(topic, timestamps, count)`.
The host receives the array and calls `registerIndex()` on the
application-owned `MediaIndexRegistry`. The DataSource plugin never
links `pj_media_core` — communication is through the C ABI write host
only. This is a one-time cost at file open, amortized over all
subsequent seeks.

**Streaming sources**: the `VideoDecoder` builds the index
incrementally. On each new entry it NAL-parses the first few bytes to
detect IDR frames and calls `appendKeyframe()`. This is per-entry
overhead but is amortized over live playback — at 30 fps, one
NAL-header check per frame is negligible.

### Usage by VideoDecoder

When `VideoDecoder` needs to seek to timestamp `T` (using the
`ObjectTopicId` it was constructed with):

1. `registry.keyframeBefore(topic_id, T)` → returns `kf_ts`.
2. `ObjectStore::indexAt(topic_id, kf_ts)` → gets the keyframe's index
   `i` in the entry sequence.
3. `ObjectStore::at(topic, i)` → gets the keyframe bytes. Decode it
   after calling `avcodec_flush_buffers` to reset decoder state.
4. Iterate `ObjectStore::at(topic, i+1)`, `at(topic, i+2)`, ...
   decoding each P/B frame until reaching the entry at timestamp `T`.

Because live and scrub modes are mutually exclusive (§R4.3), the buffer
is frozen during this seek — no entry can be evicted between steps 2
and 4.

### Thread safety

`MediaIndexRegistry` is protected by its own `shared_mutex`.
`registerIndex` and `appendKeyframe` take exclusive locks;
`keyframeBefore` takes a shared lock. The registry is independent of
`ObjectStore`'s locking.

---

## 7. Rendering Pipeline

### 7.1 QRhiWidget

`MediaViewerWidget` subclasses `QRhiWidget` (Qt 6.8+), which abstracts
over Vulkan, Metal, D3D11, and OpenGL at runtime. The widget:

1. Creates GPU textures for YUV planes (Y, U, V for YUV420P; Y+UV for
   NV12; Y+UV for P010 with 10-bit depth).
2. On each render tick, polls `FrameSlot::take()`.
3. If a new frame arrived: uploads plane data to GPU textures via
   `QRhiResourceUpdateBatch`.
4. Draws a full-screen quad with the YUV-to-RGB fragment shader.

### 7.2 YUV-to-RGB shaders

Fragment shader performs BT.601 or BT.709 color conversion:

```glsl
// Simplified — actual shader handles NV12/P010/YUV420P variants
vec3 yuv = vec3(
    texture(y_plane, uv).r,
    texture(u_plane, uv).r - 0.5,
    texture(v_plane, uv).r - 0.5
);
fragColor = vec4(bt709_matrix * yuv, 1.0);
```

The color matrix is selected based on the video's color space metadata
(from FFmpeg's `AVFrame::colorspace`). Default is BT.709 for HD
content, BT.601 for SD.

### 7.3 Zoom and pan

A 3x3 view transform matrix in the vertex shader handles zoom
(mouse-wheel, cursor-anchored) and pan (mouse drag):

```glsl
gl_Position = vec4(view_matrix * vec3(in_position, 1.0), 1.0);
```

The transform is updated on mouse events and stored as widget state.
No pixel reprocessing — transformation is free on the GPU.

### 7.4 Software fallback

When `QRhi` reports no suitable GPU backend, or when the platform
lacks GPU support:

1. Decoder falls back to software decode (guaranteed by
   `VideoDecoder`'s fallback logic).
2. CPU-side YUV→RGB conversion via sws_scale or manual matrix
   multiply.
3. Upload RGB pixels to a `QImage` and render via `QPainter`.

Acceptable degradation; the UX remains functional.

---

## 8. Multi-Layer Compositor

A viewer widget may composite multiple ObjectStore topics at the same
display time (§R4.8). The `Compositor` class orchestrates this.

### 8.1 Layer model

Each layer is a `(topic, decoder, blend_mode, z_order)` tuple
configured at widget construction time. Layer types:

| Layer type | Decoder | Output |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Base image/video | `VideoDecoder` or `ImageDecoder` | RGB/YUV pixel buffer |
| Annotation overlay | `SceneDecoder` | List of 2D primitives (rasterized onto the base) |
| Depth colormap | `ImageDecoder` (mono16) | False-color pixel buffer (colormap applied by compositor) |
| Segmentation mask | `ImageDecoder` | Indexed-color pixel buffer (alpha-blended) |

### 8.2 Compositing pipeline

On each render tick, the `PlaybackController`'s worker thread:

1. Queries `ObjectStore::latestAt(topic, ts)` for each layer.
2. Decodes each layer independently via its decoder.
3. Passes all decoded outputs to the `Compositor`.
4. The `Compositor` applies layer ordering and blending:
   - Base layer rendered first.
   - Overlays rasterized on top (annotations as vector primitives,
     depth/segmentation as alpha-blended pixel buffers).
5. The composited `CompositeFrame` is written to the `FrameSlot`.

### 8.3 At-or-before semantics

Every layer query uses `latestAt` — strict at-or-before, never a
future entry (§R4.8). A 10 Hz detection overlay composited on a
60 Hz video is correct: the same bounding box persists across
multiple video frames until replaced by a newer annotation.

No automatic skew rejection. Multi-rate is the norm — the compositor
trusts that an entry exists in the store until explicitly evicted.

### 8.4 frame_id correlation (optional)

When an overlay's metadata carries a `frame_id` matching a specific
source image, the compositor may prefer exact pairing over
timestamp-based pairing. Layers without `frame_id` fall back to
timestamp matching.

---

## 9. Clock Integration

### 9.1 TimelineCursor

`TimelineCursor` is a small read-only interface declared in `pj_base`.
The application owns it; widgets subscribe to it via a callback or
observer pattern.

```cpp
// In pj_base — exact signatures TBD
class TimelineCursor {
 public:
  using TimestampCallback = std::function<void(int64_t ns)>;

  void subscribe(TimestampCallback cb);
  void unsubscribe(/* handle */);

  int64_t currentTimestamp() const;
};
```

Widgets only subscribe, never drive. The application advances the
cursor — from a slider, from a playback timer, from an external
sync source.

### 9.2 Rate hints

DataSource plugins publish optional hints at startup:

- `preferred_fps`: natural frame rate of the source (e.g., 30.0 for
  a 30 fps video).
- `natural_range_ns`: total duration of the dataset.

The application's clock aggregates hints across sources and picks a
default playback pace. The user may override.

### 9.3 Live vs scrub mode

The application manages the live/scrub mode transition (§R4.3).
From pj_media's perspective:

- **Live mode**: `TimelineCursor` advances at the live edge. The
  `PlaybackController` requests the newest timestamp on each tick.
  Each `ObjectStore::latestAt` returns the most recent entry.

- **Scrub mode**: `TimelineCursor` is driven by user interaction
  (slider drag). The `PlaybackController` requests the user-selected
  timestamp. The buffer is frozen — no pushes, no eviction.

The `PlaybackController` does not know or care which mode is active.
It reacts identically: receive timestamp → query store → decode →
composite → slot. The mode distinction is entirely in whether the
cursor advances automatically or manually, and whether the DataSource
is actively pushing.

---

## 10. Threading Model

### 10.1 Thread roles

| Thread | Responsibilities | Lock discipline |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Qt main thread** | UI events, `QTimer` render tick, `FrameSlot::take()`, GPU upload, widget lifecycle | Never blocks on decode. Never holds ObjectStore locks longer than a `latestAt` call |
| **PlaybackController worker** (1 per widget) | `ObjectStore::latestAt` queries, decoder invocation, compositing, `FrameSlot::store()` | Acquires ObjectStore shared locks (released immediately after handle copy). Holds decoder-internal state exclusively |
| **DataSource poll thread** (1 per app, existing) | `DataSource::poll()` → `ObjectStore::pushOwned/pushLazy` | Acquires ObjectStore exclusive locks per push. Never touches decoders |

### 10.2 Lock inventory

| Lock | Type | Protects | Held by |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| `ObjectSeries::mutex` (§OS3.4) | `shared_mutex` | Per-topic entry storage | Shared: worker threads via `latestAt`/`at`/`indexAt`. Exclusive: poll thread via `pushOwned`/`pushLazy`/eviction |
| `FrameSlot::mutex_` | `mutex` | Single-frame mailbox | Worker: `store()`. Main: `take()`. Never held concurrently — always < 1 us |
| `MediaIndexRegistry::mutex_` | `shared_mutex` | Keyframe index | Shared: worker via `keyframeBefore`. Exclusive: DataSource via `registerIndex`, worker via `appendKeyframe` |

### 10.3 Lock ordering

No nested locking across the three lock families. Each lock is
acquired and released independently — never held simultaneously:

1. Worker acquires `ObjectSeries::mutex` (shared) → copies
   `shared_ptr` handle → releases lock.
2. Worker decodes (no locks held — decoder operates on owned data).
   For streaming video, if the decoder detects a keyframe via NAL
   inspection, it calls `MediaIndexRegistry::appendKeyframe()` which
   acquires `MediaIndexRegistry::mutex_` (exclusive) → appends →
   releases. This happens after the ObjectStore lock is released.
3. Worker acquires `FrameSlot::mutex_` → stores frame → releases.

The main thread only ever acquires `FrameSlot::mutex_` (via `take()`).
It never touches ObjectStore or MediaIndexRegistry directly.

### 10.4 Contention analysis

- **ObjectStore shared_mutex**: at typical media frame rates (30-60
  fps), the push thread holds an exclusive lock for ~1 us per entry
  (deque append + timestamp vector append + optional eviction).
  Worker threads hold shared locks for ~1 us per query (binary search
  + shared_ptr copy). Contention is effectively zero.
- **FrameSlot mutex**: held for < 1 us on both sides (store is a
  move; take is a move). Zero contention in practice.
- **MediaIndexRegistry shared_mutex**: reads (binary search) are
  O(log k) where k is the number of keyframes. Writes
  (`appendKeyframe`) are O(1) amortized. Negligible contention.

### 10.5 Error propagation across threads

Errors from decoder workers must not propagate as C++ exceptions
across the worker→UI thread boundary (§R5). The error flow:

1. **Worker thread**: decoder methods return `PJ::Expected<DecodedFrame>`
   or similar. If a decoder fails (corrupt data, unsupported codec,
   HW-accel error), the worker catches the failure at the thread
   boundary.
2. **Last-error state**: the `PlaybackController` stores the error in
   a thread-safe last-error field (atomic or mutex-protected). The
   `FrameSlot` is NOT written to on error — the widget continues
   displaying the last good frame.
3. **UI thread**: on its next poll, the widget checks the last-error
   state. If set, it renders a visible error indicator (e.g., "decode
   failed" overlay or a no-signal background) on the affected layer.
4. **Recovery**: the error state is cleared when the next successful
   decode completes.

**Missing data is not an error**: when `ObjectStore::latestAt` returns
`nullopt` on a valid topic (e.g., the cursor is before the first
entry), the widget renders a "no data" indicator without raising,
logging, or surfacing an error condition.

### 10.6 EntryTimestampsView and extended locks

`ObjectStore::entryTimestamps()` returns an `EntryTimestampsView` that
holds a `shared_lock` for its lifetime (§OS4). pj_media's
`VideoDecoder` may use it during seek planning (batch timestamp
access). The lock is shared (readers-only), so it does not block other
decoders, but it blocks the push thread for the view's lifetime.

Rule: any code path that acquires an `EntryTimestampsView` must drop
it promptly — copy timestamps into a local vector if further
processing is needed beyond the search. Never hold a view across a
decode call.

## 11. Port Map

What to take from each reference prototype and what to leave behind.

### From `video_player_lab/`

| Component | Action | Target in pj_media | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| `FrameSlot` | **PORT** | `pj_media_core/frame_slot.h` | Copy the ~60-line implementation. Change identity from `size_t index` to `int64_t timestamp_ns`. The mechanism is identical |
| Direction-aware cancel-store | **PORT** | `PlaybackController` | Port the request-level direction tracking from `FrameProvider::bg_loop`. Replace frame-index comparison with timestamp comparison. See `~/ws_plotjuggler/video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.6` for the exact rule |
| `VideoDecoder::flush()` at EOF | **PORT** | `VideoDecoder` | 3 lines: send NULL packet, drain buffered frames. Currently missing in the parallel pj_media effort |
| `ENOMEM` recovery | **PORT** | `VideoDecoder` | On `AVERROR(ENOMEM)`: `avcodec_flush_buffers` + retry once. Hit during scrub testing |
| `FrameCache` (JPEG cache) | **DO NOT PORT** | — | pj_media's image subsystem doesn't need it (on-the-fly JPEG decode is fast enough). Video decoded-frame caching, if needed, will use a proximity-based strategy specific to pj_media's `VideoDecoder` |
| `FrameConverter` | **DO NOT PORT** | — | Equivalent HW→SW transfer exists in pj_media's `VideoDecoder` |
| `Mp4DataSource` | **DO NOT PORT** | — | pj_media handles MP4 via `FFmpegVideoSource`. The prototype's demuxer is narrower |
| `PlaybackClock` | **DO NOT PORT** | — | Replaced by pj_media's `TimelineCursor` subscription model |
| `VideoWidget` (QRhiWidget) | **DO NOT PORT** | — | pj_media already has `MediaViewerWidget` with the same QRhi + shader approach plus additional features (pixel inspector) |
| Keyframe pre-decode at open | **CONDITIONAL** | — | Only if a product decision requires a scrub-preview thumbnail strip. Port as opt-in `KeyframeThumbnails`, not baked into open(). See `~/ws_plotjuggler/video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.7` |

### From `~/ws_plotjuggler/pj_media/` (parallel effort)

| Component | Action | Target in pj_media | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| QRhiWidget + YUV shaders | **CHERRY-PICK** | `MediaViewerWidget` | The shader code and QRhi setup are production-ready. Adapt to pj_media_core's frame types |
| FFmpegVideoSource / VideoDecoder | **CHERRY-PICK** | `VideoDecoder` | HW-accel probing, codec open/close, sws_scale paths. Strip the push-based delivery and replace with FrameSlot |
| `FrameSlot` (already ported from video_player_lab) | **USE AS-IS** | — | Already present in the parallel effort |
| ImageSource + BufferStrategy | **ADAPT** | `ImageDecoder` | The per-topic buffer strategy is more complex than needed for pj_media_core's stateless `ImageDecoder`. Take the turbojpeg/libpng dispatch; leave the caching strategy |
| PayloadDescriptor bytecode VM | **EVALUATE** | — | Clever but complex. Evaluate whether the simpler approach (metadata_json + decoder dispatch) suffices before porting |
| TimelineBridge | **DO NOT PORT** | — | Replaced by `TimelineCursor` in pj_base |
| Timestamp µs vs ns dichotomy | **FIX** | — | pj_media uses ns everywhere. The parallel effort's video engine used µs internally. All internal timestamps must be int64_t nanoseconds |

### From `plotjuggler_core/pj_media/mcap_player/`

| Component | Action | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `LazyMediaSeries<T>` callback model | **VALIDATED** | The pattern (timestamps + resolve closures capturing shared_ptr) is sound and maps directly to ObjectStore's `pushLazy` with fetch callbacks. The mcap_player sandbox validated the approach. No code to port — ObjectStore implements the pattern natively |
| `CompressedImageParser` (CDR → turbojpeg) | **REFERENCE** | Demonstrates the parser → decoder split. In pj_media proper, the CDR envelope peeling is a `MessageParser` plugin; the turbojpeg decode is `ImageDecoder` |

## Appendix: Key Invariants

These invariants are load-bearing. Violating any of them reintroduces
bugs that were already proven unfixable by patching.

1. **No Qt signals for frame delivery.** The FrameSlot mailbox is the
   only path from decoder to display. Adding a signal escape hatch
   reintroduces stale-frame interleaving. (Proof:
   `video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.2-3.3`)

2. **One FrameSlot per widget, never per layer.** Compositing happens
   before the slot, not after. The UI thread sees exactly one
   composited frame per poll.

3. **Backward scrub suppresses partial publications.** Forward partials
   are fine; backward partials show frames moving in the wrong
   direction. (Proof: `video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.6`)

4. **ObjectStore handles are owning.** A decoder can hold a byte handle
   while the store pushes and evicts. No use-after-free is possible.
   (Guarantee: §OS3.4, §OS4)

5. **Live and scrub are mutually exclusive.** During scrub, the buffer
   is frozen — no pushes, no eviction. Seek sequences (keyframe →
   decode forward) cannot race with eviction. (Requirement: §R4.3)

6. **Keyframe tracking is pj_media's concern, not ObjectStore's.**
   ObjectStore is codec-agnostic (§OS3.6). `MediaIndexRegistry` owns
   keyframe indices. (Decision: §R4.2, §R4.4)

7. **Parsers are codec-agnostic envelope peelers.** They never inspect
   NAL types, keyframe flags, or GOP structure. All codec knowledge
   lives in pj_media's decoder classes. (Decision: §R4.4)
